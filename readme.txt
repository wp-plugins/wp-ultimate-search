== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I customize the search results template? =

When a search is executed, the plugin first looks in your current theme directory for the file wpus-results-template.php. If no file is found, it falls back to the default results template, located in /wp-ultimate-search/views/wpus-results-template.php.

To customize the template, first copy the wpus-results-template.php file into your theme directory. The code within this file is a standard WordPress loop, which you can modify in any way you choose. To learn more about WordPress loops, see the codex.
